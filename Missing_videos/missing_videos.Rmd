Script that takes a folder of matlabs and a folder containing  csv's with creation times and outputs a list of Trials that have matching (closets to, but no more than 5 seconds away) videos

adjust source, matpath and creapath


```{r}

library(R.matlab)
library(tidyverse)
library(purrr)


source("E:/Florian/Github/Master_thesis/Missing_videos/missing_video_helper.r")

matpath = "C:/Users/deepl/Desktop/a/mat"
creapath = "C:/Users/deepl/Desktop/a/times"

```

```{r}
data <- mat_to_tibble(matpath)
data <- add_times(data)
creas <- load_creas_times(creapath)

data <- data %>% filter(name=='HIT') %>% select(id,Behv,Trial2,timediff)
```


```{r}
# Apply the matching function by group
creas2 <- creas %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  group_map(~ match_within_group(.x, data %>% filter(id == .y$id[1])),.keep = T) %>%
  bind_rows()

to_keep <- creas2 %>% left_join(data %>% ungroup(), by = join_by(id,closest_hit_time==timediff)) %>% select(!closest_hit_idx) %>% mutate(timediff = CreationTime-closest_hit_time)  %>% filter(abs(timediff) < 5) %>% mutate(video = sprintf("%03d", video))

to_keep %>% select(id,Trial2,video,Behv) %>% write_csv('C:/Users/deepl/Desktop/matched_videos.csv')

```
